# Simple Todo App

As part of the TripleTen Software Engineering Bootcamp, this simple "To-Do App" creates a user interface for adding and removing tasks, as well as marking them as complete.

## Functionality

Give a more detailed explanation of the project and its functionality.
A user is able to use the "Add Todo" button to create a new task with an optional Due Date. The task is then added to list with the ability to mark as complete or delete from the list. If a due date is provided, that date will display with the corresponding task.

## Technology

Give a description of the technologies and techniques used. Pictures, GIFs, or screenshots that detail the project features are recommended.
The main purpose of this project was to familiarize myself with JavaScript modules. Within the project framework I utilized separate JavaScript classes for different functionality, from the Todo list to the Form Validation, and used import/export functionality to create a seamless UI.

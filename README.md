# Simple Todo App

As part of the **TripleTen Software Engineering Bootcamp**, this **"To-Do App"** provides an intuitive user interface for managing tasks. Users can **add, delete, and mark tasks as complete**, with optional due dates for better organization. The project focuses on **modular JavaScript structure**, event-driven updates, and **object-oriented programming (OOP) principles**.

## **✨ Features**

- ✅ **Add new tasks** with an optional **due date**.
- ✅ **Mark tasks as complete/incomplete** dynamically.
- ✅ **Delete tasks** while updating the UI in real-time.
- ✅ **Live counter** tracking **total tasks** and **completed tasks**.
- ✅ **Form validation** to ensure user input is correct.
- ✅ **Popup modal** for task creation with proper event handling.
- ✅ **Fully modular JavaScript implementation** using ES6 Classes.

## **⚙️ Technologies Used**

This project was built to reinforce **JavaScript modules and OOP principles**.  
The following technologies and techniques were used:

- 🟡 **JavaScript (ES6+)** – Classes, Modules, Import/Export.
- 🎨 **HTML & CSS** – Styled with **BEM methodology**.
- 🏗 **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** – Encapsulated logic inside **reusable ES6 classes**.
- 🎭 **Dynamic DOM Manipulation** – Using `querySelector`, `addEventListener`, and `appendChild`.
- 🔄 **Event-Driven UI Updates** – Real-time interaction handling (e.g., marking a task complete updates the counter).
- ✅ **Form Validation** – Prevents invalid input and enhances UX.
- 🏗 **Modular File Structure** – Separated logic into **multiple classes** for easy maintenance.
